    <h1>Eggnog Creme Brulee</h1>
    <img src="../images/eggnog-creme-brulee.jpg" alt="Eggnog Creme Brulee">

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I have been making creme brulee for my wife for quite some time and one day she asked me, 'Honey, is it possible to make creme brulee out of eggnog? I think that would be so yummy.' So, I bought some eggnog and set about finding out if it is possible, and it is. You can also take the same recipe and pour it into a prepared pie crust for an eggnog custard pie. It's a lot less work and hassle than individual ramekins.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients for 4 servings</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups eggnog </li>
        <li>4 egg yolks</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup white sugar </li>
        <li>3 ounces mascarpone cheese, softened </li>
        <li>1 dash ground nutmeg (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 dash ground cinnamon (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place 4 ramekins or custard cups into a shallow baking dish, and fill the dish with water to half-way up the sides of the ramekins.</li>
        <li>Pour the eggnog into a pan over medium heat. Cook and stir occasionally until the mixture simmers, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, place the egg yolks and sugar into a mixing bowl; beat until light colored and frothy. Stir in the mascarpone until well blended and smooth. Whisk 1/4 cup of the heated eggnog mixture into the eggs. Gradually whisk the remaining eggnog into the eggs. Pour the mixture through a fine sieve to remove any egg strands. If desired, stir in the nutmeg, cinnamon, and vanilla. Pour into the prepared ramekins, dividing evenly.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until custard has set, 30 to 45 minutes. Centers should wiggle slightly when shaken, but not be soupy.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven and cool 30 minutes; refrigerate at least 3 hours before serving.</li>
    </ol>
